# EXCEL-project-on-sales-analysis
Excel-based data analysis project using formulas, pivot tables, and an interactive dashboard to analyze sales performance and answer key business questions.

## Project Overview
This project is an **Excel-based data analysis and dashboarding solution** designed to analyze VIVA CALDA sales transactions and answer key business questions using formulas, pivot tables, and interactive visualizations.

The objective of the project was to transform transactional sales data into a **report-ready dataset**, perform structured analysis, and deliver an **interactive dashboard** that enables stakeholders to quickly understand sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Businesses often collect large volumes of transactional data, but without proper transformation and analysis, this data cannot effectively support decision-making.

The goal of this project was to:
- Prepare and enhance raw sales data using Excel formulas
- Create derived metrics for deeper analysis
- Analyze sales performance across products, customers, and regions
- Build an interactive dashboard to answer critical business questions

---

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains sales transaction records with fields such as:
- Transaction ID
- Product
- Quantity
- Unit Price
- Order Date and Ship Date
- Order Mode
- Customer Gender
- Ratings
- Geographic information (State and County)

The dataset was enhanced with additional analytical columns to support meaningful insights.

---

## Data Preparation & Feature Creation
Significant data transformation was performed directly in Excel:

### Key Enhancements
- **Amount**: Calculated as Quantity × Unit Price to represent total sales value
- **Days to Deliver**: Derived from the difference between Ship Date and Order Date
- **Week Number**: Extracted from Order Date for time-based analysis
- **Gender Value**: Standardized customer gender values for consistent reporting

These steps converted the dataset into an **analysis-ready structure** suitable for aggregation and visualization.

---

## Analysis & Pivot Tables
The project uses pivot tables as the core analytical engine:

- Aggregated sales by product, gender, order mode, and geography
- Analyzed delivery performance using derived delivery-time metrics
- Evaluated customer ratings across different segments
- Applied filtering and grouping logic equivalent to SQL-style analysis

All KPIs and summaries are driven directly from pivot tables to ensure accuracy and scalability.

---

## Dashboard & Visualization
An **interactive Excel dashboard** was created to present insights clearly and effectively.

### Dashboard Features
- Key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Sales and performance charts
- Interactive filters for dynamic exploration
- Consistent color palette and branding

The dashboard enables quick insight generation without manual recalculation.
